## Bubble Tea Ordering Website 
(Build with 2 other teammates)


The purpose of this project is to build a bubble tea ordering website. It not only provides the customers with the basic information of the bubble tea shop, but also provides applicants who want to join the brand a direct way to apply. Specifically, the customers can sign up and then log in to / log out of their account, browse through the menu by different categories, place orders, view order history, and view store locations. The website also contains statistics on best selling products, items that were ordered by every customer, and the number of customers who have made a purchase.
